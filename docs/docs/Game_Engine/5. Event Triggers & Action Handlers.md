Hey Ian, it's skippy. Here’s what you need to do to tackle this task:

### Steps to Accomplish the Task

1. **Define the Event Structure:**
    
    - **Event Class:** Create a class (e.g., `Event`) that encapsulates:
        
        - A **name** for identification.
            
        - A **condition function** that takes the current game state and returns `True` if the event should trigger.
            
        - An **action function** that performs the necessary updates to the game state.
            
2. **Create an Event Handler:**
    
    - **Event Handler Class:** Develop a class (e.g., `EventHandler`) that can:
        
        - **Register events:** Allow events to be added to the system.
            
        - **Process events:** Iterate through registered events, check their conditions against the current game state, and execute their actions if conditions are met.
            
3. **Implement Condition and Action Functions:**
    
    - **Condition Functions:** Write functions that check for specific trigger conditions. For example, check if the player is in a specific location, possesses an item, or if a flag is set.
        
    - **Action Functions:** Write functions that update the game state based on the event. For instance, setting a flag to indicate that a door is open or adding a new exit to a location.
        
4. **Provide an Example Event:**
    
    - **Example—Opening a Door:**
        
        - **Condition:** The player is in the “hallway”, has the “key” in their inventory, and the door is not already open.
            
        - **Action:** Update the game state to mark the door as open and add a new exit (like “door” leading to “secret_room”).
            
5. **Integrate with the Game State:**
    
    - Ensure that your event system works with the game state structure (which might be a dictionary or a more complex object). The event system should be able to check and update the game state accordingly.

### Sample Code Implementation

Below is the Python code for an event handler system. Save this as a file (e.g., `narrative_engine/events.py`) in your module:

```python
# narrative_engine/events.py

class Event:
    def __init__(self, name, condition, action):
        """
        :param name: A string identifier for the event.
        :param condition: A function that takes game_state and returns True if the event should trigger.
        :param action: A function that takes game_state and performs the event action.
        """
        self.name = name
        self.condition = condition
        self.action = action

    def check_and_execute(self, game_state):
        """
        Checks if the event's condition is met and executes the action if so.
        :param game_state: The current game state (e.g., a dict or custom object).
        :return: True if the event was triggered and executed, False otherwise.
        """
        if self.condition(game_state):
            self.action(game_state)
            return True
        return False

class EventHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.events = []

    def register_event(self, event):
        """
        Registers a new event to be processed.
        :param event: An instance of Event.
        """
        self.events.append(event)

    def process_events(self, game_state):
        """
        Processes all registered events by checking their conditions against the game state.
        :param game_state: The current game state.
        :return: A list of names of the events that were triggered.
        """
        triggered_events = []
        for event in self.events:
            if event.check_and_execute(game_state):
                triggered_events.append(event.name)
        return triggered_events

# Example: Event trigger for opening a door

def door_condition(game_state):
    """
    Check if the player is in the hallway, has a key, and the door is not already open.
    :param game_state: Dict with keys like 'current_location', 'inventory', and 'flags'.
    """
    return (
        game_state.get('current_location') == 'hallway' and 
        'key' in game_state.get('inventory', []) and 
        not game_state.get('flags', {}).get('door_open', False)
    )

def door_action(game_state):
    """
    Update the game state to mark the door as open and add a new exit.
    :param game_state: Dict with keys like 'flags' and 'exits'.
    """
    # Set the door flag to open
    game_state.setdefault('flags', {})['door_open'] = True
    # Add a new exit called 'door' that leads to a secret room
    game_state.setdefault('exits', {})['door'] = 'secret_room'
    print("The door creaks open, revealing a secret room.")

# Create an event instance for opening a door
open_door_event = Event("Open Door", door_condition, door_action)
```

### Recap

- **Define an Event Class:** Encapsulate the event name, condition, and action.
    
- **Create an Event Handler:** Manage event registration and processing.
    
- **Write Condition & Action Functions:** Ensure they check the game state and update it accordingly.
    
- **Provide a Simple Example:** The door event checks if the player is in the "hallway" with a "key" and, if so, opens the door to a secret room.
    

This setup lets you easily add more events and integrate the event processing into your game loop. Let me know if you need further tweaks or details, Ian!
