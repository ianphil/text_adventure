## Detailed Game Engine Blueprint

### 1. **Core Engine Architecture**

#### a. Story Graph Manager

- **Purpose:**  
    Manages the branching narrative structure and connections between scenes.
    
- **Key Functions:**
    
    - **Node Management:** Each “location” or scene is a node in the story graph.
        
    - **Edges/Transitions:** Define actions that move the player from one node to another.
        
    - **Dynamic Updates:** Allow AI to inject or modify narrative details based on player actions.
        
- **Considerations:**
    
    - Use a dictionary or JSON-based configuration for initial static nodes.
        
    - Provide flexibility for adding AI-generated nodes dynamically.
        

#### b. Game State Manager

- **Purpose:**  
    Tracks the current state of the game, including player position, inventory, and progress flags.
    
- **Key Functions:**
    
    - **Session Persistence:** Save/load functionality using Flask-Session and SQLite/SQLAlchemy.
        
    - **State Updates:** Reflect changes as the player interacts with the game.
        
    - **History Tracking:** Maintain a log of player decisions to inform AI narrative memory.
        
- **Considerations:**
    
    - Design a clear data model for the game state to ensure smooth transitions.
        

#### c. Command Parser

- **Purpose:**  
    Interprets natural language inputs or command selections.
    
- **Key Functions:**
    
    - **Input Handling:** Process text commands like “go north” or “take key.”
        
    - **Synonym & Abbreviation Support:** Recognize “n” for “north,” “i” for inventory, etc.
        
    - **Fuzzy Matching:** Allow minor typos or similar phrases to match valid commands.
        
- **Considerations:**
    
    - Implement a mapping of common commands and synonyms.
        
    - Consider using regex or simple NLP techniques for command matching.
        

#### d. Event Triggers & Action Handlers

- **Purpose:**  
    Execute in-game events based on commands and changes in the game state.
    
- **Key Functions:**
    
    - **Trigger Conditions:** Define events that activate based on state flags or item possession.
        
    - **Action Execution:** Update the story graph and game state accordingly.
        
    - **Feedback Loop:** Return narrative text and available actions to the frontend.

    - **Item:** Interactive objects and their properties.
        
    - **Action:** Possible commands and transitions.
        
    - **NarrativePrompt:** Templates for generating AI content.
        
    - **GeneratedContent:** Cached AI-generated narrative pieces.
        
    - **StoryMemory:** Log of major narrative events to maintain storyline coherence.
        
- **Considerations:**
    
    - Use Flask-SQLAlchemy to define and manage these models.
        
    - Normalize relationships (e.g., linking player actions to game state changes).
        

#### c. Caching and Session Management

- **Key Elements:**
    
    - **Redis:** Cache AI-generated content and frequently accessed data.
        
    - **Flask-Session:** Maintain user sessions for game continuity.

## Set of Prompts for Generating the Game Engine

Here are some starter prompts you can use (or modify) to generate different components of your game engine:

1. **Story Graph Manager:**
    
    ```
    Create a Python module for managing a branching narrative graph. The module should include functions to add, remove, and update nodes and transitions. Each node represents a game location with a description, available exits, items, and actions. Include a sample JSON configuration for a simple starting location.
    ```
    
2. **Game State Manager:**
    
    ```
    Write a Python class using Flask-SQLAlchemy that manages the game state. This class should handle player progress, inventory, current location, and decision history. Include methods to save and load the state from a SQLite database.
    ```
    
3. **Command Parser:**
    
    ```
    Develop a Python function that parses natural language commands in a text-based adventure game. The function should support abbreviations (like "n" for "north") and perform fuzzy matching for typos. Include example mappings and sample command tests.
    ```
    
4. **Event Trigger and Action Handler:**
    
    ```
    Generate Python code for an event handler system that processes player actions in a text adventure game. The system should check for trigger conditions (such as item possession or specific location flags) and update the game state accordingly. Provide a simple example of an event trigger for opening a door.
    ```
    
5. **AI-Driven Content Generation Module:**
    
    ```
    Create a Python module that integrates with the OpenAI API to generate dynamic narrative content. The module should take a narrative prompt template and dynamic variables (e.g., location type, tone, required elements) to generate text. Include error handling and caching using Redis.
    ```
    
6. **API Endpoints:**
    
    ```
    Write a Flask blueprint that defines API endpoints for starting a game, processing actions, saving the game state, loading a saved game, and retrieving the current game state. Ensure that each endpoint properly validates inputs and returns JSON responses.
    ```
    
7. **Testing Components:**
    
    ```
    Write unit tests for the command parser function. The tests should cover valid commands, abbreviations, and fuzzy matching for incorrect inputs. Use Python's unittest or pytest framework.
    ```
    
8. **Integration and Deployment Scripts:**
    
    ```
    Create a Dockerfile for the Flask backend application and a docker-compose file that includes services for the Flask app, SQLite/PostgreSQL, and Redis for caching. Provide sample commands to build and run the containerized application.
    ```
